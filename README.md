# Project Title
*REAl TIME BUS TRACKER*
## Description of the project

This is a simple project, that I programmed as part of the MIT Full Stack Development with MERN. The project has three files: bustracker.html, myStyles.css and mbtaTracker.js and a readme.md file. Basically in the mbtaTracker.js file there is a fuction that fetched information from the mbta website. This information is fetch as a json file and contains data about the buses' route in the city of Massachusetts. the JS file also has others function for loading a map using the mapboxgl api/library, a function for adding markers on the map for each bus at any given time circulation on the streets of Massachusetts and for updating the buses' locations. Finally there is another function for updating the markers with the latitude and longitude of each bus circulating on the streets. 

## How to Run 

At this stage of the project there are not any special requirements for running the web application, just open the index html file in a browers an all the information should be shown on the page. 

## Roadmap of futre improvement

Some future improvements are:

* Change the color of the markers depending on the bus direction. For example a bus moving north is going to have differenct marker color that a bus moving south.
* Add in the page a buttons to allow the user change the rate at which the data is fetched from the MBTA website. At the moment the information is loaded every 15,000 milliseconds. 
* Add a menu to allow the user select among other cities for which real time data can be shown of the public transportation system (buses).
